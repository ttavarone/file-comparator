# file-comparator
Author: Tucker Tavarone
Version: 1.0

Simple application to compare two ".txt" files.  May be able to check other file types in the near future (I.e. picture files).

When files are opened and compared, they are added to a log and added to the resources directory.  This will allow the comparator to make quick comparisons next time and improves the overall efficiency of the application.
